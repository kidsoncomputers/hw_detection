#TODO:  add more robust paths
#more clarification...
#TODO:  do we note anywhere that this may need to be run with sudo perms?
#Added If statement to check for root user. Some commands will not run without user being root. 
#TODO:  align our output with the windows script output
#TODO:  verify outputs of USB check
#Does the test need to be more specific than just if the cd, dvd, or usb exist?  
#TODO:  deal with multiple processor output (eg, my thinkpad shows a ton of crap we don't want)
#I can't repro this. Can someone else? 
#TODO:  filter crap out of lspci output

#Same as above
